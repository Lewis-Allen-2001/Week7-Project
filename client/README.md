Assignment Reflection on Week 7 Project
This project provided valuable insights into the software development process, from conception to implementation.

Project Overview
The goal was to develop a web application featuring a header, game list, game details page, and user authentication system. The app fetches and displays game data via an API, incorporating local storage for user data, a dynamic upgrade system for in-game items, and responsive design for mobile and desktop users.

Key Learnings
Component-Based Architecture: Improved code organization and reusability by creating separate components for key features.

API Integration: Learned effective data fetching and display, enhancing my understanding of JavaScript and asynchronous requests.

Responsive Design: Adopted a mobile-first approach, utilizing media queries to ensure visual appeal and functionality across devices.

Local Storage Implementation: Gained hands-on experience with JavaScriptâ€™s local storage API for managing user sessions.

Debugging and Problem-Solving: Developed critical thinking and troubleshooting skills by addressing various project challenges.

Challenges Faced
Time Management: Balancing multiple components was overwhelming, requiring effective prioritization and deadlines.

Styling Consistency: Achieving uniform styling across components took longer than anticipated, necessitating experimentation with CSS frameworks.

User Authentication: Implementing a secure authentication system was challenging, particularly in managing edge cases like incorrect logins.

Conclusion
The Week 7 Project enriched my development skills, particularly in API integration and responsive design. It deepened my appreciation for user experience, preparing me for future challenges in creating engaging web applications.
